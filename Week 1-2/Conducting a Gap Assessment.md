# 📊 Conducting a Gap Assessment – ISO/IEC 27001:2022

## 📖 Overview
A **Gap Assessment** (or Gap Analysis) is the first major step in implementing an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**.  
It helps identify where your organization currently stands versus what is required to comply with **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**.

By conducting a gap assessment, you can understand the **current maturity level**, uncover **missing processes or controls**, and develop a **roadmap** for achieving certification.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To evaluate the organization’s existing information security practices against the **requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2022** and identify **gaps** that need to be addressed.

---

## 🧩 Purpose of the Gap Assessment
- Understand the **current state** of information security.  
- Identify **non-compliance** or missing elements of ISO 27001:2022.  
- Assess the **readiness** for ISMS implementation or certification.  
- Provide a **baseline** for improvement and project planning.  

---

## 🔍 Scope of the Assessment
The assessment should cover:
- **All clauses (4–10)** of ISO/IEC 27001:2022  
- **Annex A controls (93 controls in 4 themes):**
  - Organizational Controls  
  - People Controls  
  - Physical Controls  
  - Technological Controls

## 🧱 Key Steps in Conducting a Gap Assessment

### 1. Define the Assessment Scope
- Determine which departments, systems, and locations are included.  
- Align with the **ISMS Scope Document** (Clause 4.3).

### 2. Collect Existing Information
Gather existing policies, procedures, and records such as:
- IT policies and security guidelines  
- Risk assessments and incident reports  
- Access control and network diagrams  
- HR security and training records  

### 3. Review Against ISO 27001:2022 Requirements
Compare the organization’s existing practices against:
- **Clauses 4–10** (ISMS Framework)
- **Annex A** controls (Implementation controls)

### 4. Identify Gaps
Mark each requirement as:
- ✅ **Compliant** – Fully implemented and effective  
- ⚙️ **Partially Compliant** – Exists but needs improvement  
- ❌ **Non-Compliant** – Not implemented or missing  

### 5. Document Findings
Create a detailed **Gap Assessment Report** highlighting:
- Gap description  
- Current state  
- Required actions  
- Responsible owner  
- Priority and timeline  

### 6. Develop an Action Plan
Prepare a **remediation plan** with timelines, resources, and ownership to close identified gaps.
