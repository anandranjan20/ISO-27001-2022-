# ISO 27001:2022 – Documents, Specifications, and Records

## Introduction
The **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** standard requires organizations to establish and maintain specific **documents, specifications, and records** to demonstrate compliance with the **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** framework.  
These elements provide transparency, traceability, and evidence of effective information security management.

---

## 1. Documents
**Documents** define the *policies, processes, and procedures* used to establish and maintain the ISMS.

### Key ISO 27001:2022 Documents:
- **Information Security Policy** – Sets the organization’s direction and commitment to security.  
- **Scope of the ISMS** – Defines boundaries and applicability.  
- **Risk Assessment & Treatment Methodology** – Outlines the approach to managing risks.  
- **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** – Lists applicable controls and their implementation status.  
- **Roles and Responsibilities** – Defines accountability for ISMS management.  
- **Operational Procedures** – Includes incident response, access control, backup, and monitoring.  
- **Supplier and Asset Management Policies** – Defines controls for third parties and asset handling.  

> 📘 *Documents describe what must be done and how it should be done.*

---

## 2. Specifications
**Specifications** define *the technical or procedural requirements* necessary to meet the organization’s ISMS objectives and controls.

### Key ISO 27001:2022 Specifications:
- **Control Specifications (Annex A)** – Defines 93 updated controls across 4 domains:  
  1. Organizational  
  2. People  
  3. Physical  
  4. Technological  
- **Security Baselines** – Minimum security configurations (e.g., password policy, encryption levels).  
- **Configuration Standards** – System and network hardening guidelines.  
- **Monitoring and Logging Specifications** – Define what, where, and how to log for accountability.  
- **Change Management Procedures** – Outline how changes are assessed, approved, and recorded.  

> ⚙️ *Specifications ensure consistent, repeatable, and secure implementations.*

---

## 3. Records
**Records** provide *evidence* that the ISMS operates as intended and that controls are effectively implemented.

### Examples of ISO 27001:2022 Records:
- **Risk Assessment Reports and Logs**  
- **Incident and Breach Reports**  
- **Internal Audit Reports**  
- **Management Review Meeting Minutes**  
- **Training and Awareness Attendance Logs**  
- **Access Control and User Management Records**  
- **Backup and Restore Logs**  
- **Corrective Action and Improvement Records**

> 🗂️ *Records prove that your ISMS is working and being maintained.*

## 4. Documentation Lifecycle
ISO 27001:2022 emphasizes a **controlled documentation process**:
1. **Create** – Develop based on policies, standards, and business needs.  
2. **Review & Approve** – Ensure accuracy and compliance before release.  
3. **Publish & Communicate** – Make available to relevant personnel.  
4. **Maintain & Update** – Revise periodically or after major changes.  
5. **Archive & Retain** – Store records securely for audit and compliance.

---

## 5. Document Control Best Practices
- Use version control for all ISMS documents.  
- Restrict unauthorized editing or deletion.  
- Store documents in a secure, backed-up repository (e.g., SharePoint, Confluence, or Azure DevOps).  
- Maintain a **Document Register** with document title, owner, version, and approval date.  
- Ensure employees have access to only relevant documents based on their role.

## Summary Table

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Documents** | Describe what needs to be done | Policies, SoA, Risk Methodology |
| **Specifications** | Define how controls are applied | Config Standards, Baselines |
| **Records** | Provide evidence of actions | Audit Logs, Incident Reports |

---

## Final Note
Maintaining accurate and up-to-date **documents, specifications, and records** is essential for ISO 27001:2022 compliance.  
They demonstrate that your ISMS is not only documented but also **implemented, monitored, and continually improved**.

> 🛡️ *“If it’s not documented, it didn’t happen.” — Core principle of ISO 27001 compliance.*
